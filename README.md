## How The Web Works

To get you started on your path to building your own web app (and to help your future students build their own) it's good to have a high-level overview on how the web works.

The video below is more than you need to know, so instead, focus on the key points and terminology below.

If you'd like to watch the video, please do, but know you won't need to fully understand the process.

## Browser and Server
The internet, simply put, is a labyrinth of connected computers. When we search for the latest cat video or look up a bacon recipe, we use our computer as a browser to get that information. Those laser-fascinated kittens and bacon bomb instructions are stored on other computers, called servers.   

* **Browser** - Chrome, Firefox or even Internet Explorer, a browser is how you, as a user, access and view all of the resources on the internet.
* **Server** - A computer (usually a set of large ones) that hosts, or stores, those resources

## HTTP, Requests and Responses
In order to share all of the resources on the internet, computers communicate with each other using a kind of call and response, technically called request and response.

* **Request** - your browser tells the server something. There are two types of requests, GET and POST.
 * **GET** request - retrieves a document, image, or other internet resource
 * **POST** request - submits data to be processed, like when the user fills out a form
* **Response** - the server replies by (hopefully) delivering the resource or responding with some type of other message. For example a 404 error means the resource could not be found.


##The Components of a Webpage
When the server sends back a response, it contains a header (which is meta data about the request/response cycle) and content. The content almost always includes HTML, but can also include CSS and Javascript

* **HTML** - the content and structure of the webpage. It includes the text and media of a webpage.
* **CSS** - the style of a webpage. CSS is what gives the content formatting - including positioning, color and sizing.
* **JavaScript** - the brains of the webpage. Javascript allows a webpage to interact with the user (by responding to the mouse or keyboard) and can also do data processing.

In the CSSI prework, you will learn the fundamentals of each of these three components and will deepen your understanding of how they all work together to deliver endless amounts of content to your sleep-deprived eyes.
